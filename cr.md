# Luxury in Lockdown
What can the Covid-19 pandemic teach us about the behaviour of luxury goods in economic downturns and the lipstick index as an economic indicator? 

## Introduction
Luxury goods refer to expensive, non-essential items, such as jewellery and make-up. Typically, during economic downturns when unemployment rises and consumer spending plummets, it is generally expected for these items demand to fall with disposable income. 

However, in 2001, Leonard Lauder, the chairman of Estee Lauder, coined the term “lipstick index” after noticing significant increases in their luxury lipstick sales. Following the tragic events of 9/11, where there was widespread speculation of the US falling into recession, prestige cosmetic companies including Estee Lauder, MAC and Borghese reported over 12% growth in lipstick sales. 

> "Leonard famously stated:“When lipstick sales go up, people don’t want to buy dresses. When things get tough, women buy lipstick”."

While he is credited with the creation of the index, this phenomenon of lipstick as an indicator of economic downturn can be observed in the majority of crises. For example, the surge in makeup sales during the great depression, employment gains for prestige cosmetics in the 90s and the 11% increase in lipstick sales during the global financial crisis.

However, the covid-19 pandemic has bought unique challenges the world has never faced before including global lockdowns, travel bans, mask mandates and economic shocks that changed consumer behaviour. This blog explores how the luxury market evolved during the pandemic, particularly investigating why the lipstick index did not hold. As the second largest market for luxury goods, the USA provides an ideal case study for understanding how consumer preferences shifted in covid-19.

Across the luxury space, there was substantial variation in levels of loss and rebound. Products heavily reliant on social interaction for use, such as fragrances, jewellery and leather goods, had their revenue hit the hardest during the pandemic. In comparison, fashion experienced the smallest percentage change in revenue which could be attributed towards the rapid shift in consumer preference for high-fashion athleisure during remote working. Still, luxury fashion struggled to bounce back — a result of changing lifestyles and the move away from traditional formalwear in the new world of hybrid working. Prestige cosmetics emerged as one of the most resilient segments in the luxury space. The category experienced the second-smallest decline in revenue with a bounce back to almost pre-pandemic levels. This reinforces the lipstick index suggesting consumers seek out premium beauty products more than other luxury goods as a form of accessible indulgence during an economic downturn.
